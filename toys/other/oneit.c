	  usage: oneit [-p] [-c /dev/tty0] command [...]

	  A simple init program that runs a single supplied command line with a
	  controlling tty (so CTRL-C can kill it).

	  -p	Power off instead of rebooting when command exits.
	  -c	Which console device to use.

	  The oneit command runs the supplied command line as a child process
	  (because PID 1 has signals blocked), attached to /dev/tty0, in its
	  own session.  Then oneit reaps zombies until the child exits, at
	  which point it reboots (or with -p, powers off) the system.

// The minimum amount of work necessary to get ctrl-c and such to work is:
//
// - Fork a child (PID 1 is special: can't exit, has various signals blocked).
// - Do a setsid() (so we have our own session).
// - In the child, attach stdio to /dev/tty0 (/dev/console is special)
// - Exec the rest of the command line.
//
// PID 1 then reaps zombies until the child process it spawned exits, at which
// point it calls sync() and reboot().  I could stick a kill -1 in there.
