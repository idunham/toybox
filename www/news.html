<h2>News</h2>

<p><b>March 29, 2008</b> 
<p>Time to release <a href=downloads/toybox-0.0.5.tar.bz2>toybox 0.0.5</a>, with
new commands cp and chvt and several bugfixes.</p>

<p>More makefile targets: "make test" runs the test suite (which needs more test
scripts), and make install/install_flat/uninstall/uninstall_flat calls
make/install.sh (with options --long --symlink --force --uninstall depending
on the context).</p>

<p>Most of the work has been behind the scenes, namely a significant rewrite of
the build logic so adding each new command consists of adding a single C file to
the "toys" directory, eliminating the need to touch any other files.
There are specially formatted comments at the top of the C file to generate
the other files, see toys/hello.c for an example.  (See generated/README.txt
and <a href=code.html>code.html</a> for details.)</p>

<p><b>January 2, 2008</b> - And <a href=downloads/toybox-0.0.4.tar.bz2>toybox-0.0.4.tar.bz2</a> is out.
The new applets this time around include basename, chroot, dirname, dmesg,
help, mkfifo, netcat, patch, sha1sum, touch, and tty.</p>

<p>Note that this "touch" includes -l to set the length, which can truncate
a file or create a commpletely sparse file, good for filesystem images.</p>

<p>Expect the next release in about 6 months.</p>

<p><b>December 12, 2007</b> - Updated the list of implemented applications,
put up a <a href=todo.txt>todo list</a> and <a href=code.html>infrastructure
documentation</a>.  Expect another release towards the end of the month.</p>

<p><b>June 18, 2007</b> - Put out
<a href=downloads/toybox-0.0.3.tar.bz2>toybox-0.0.3.tar.bz2</a> since it's
been too long since I did something like that.  This one implements
catv, count, df, echo, false, oneit, pwd, sleep, sync, toysh, true, which,
and yes (which is what "make defconfig" enables).  There are several other
commands not enabled by defconfig, because they don't really work yet.</p>

<p>Most of the general infrastructure's there now, although lots of tweaking
and optimizing is still needed.  The test suite is skeletal and not entirely
checked in yet, but I'm working on that.</p>

<p>I don't have nearly as much time to work on this as I'd like, but I'm making
a little progress.</p>

<p><b>January 31, 2007</b> -
Toybox <a href=downloads/toybox-0.0.2.tar.bz2>0.0.2 release</a>.
Implements count, yes, pwd, echo, bzcat, catv, oneit, and an unfinished
skeleton of mke2fs.  Adds argument parsing logic and bunzip code to library.
Now configured with menuconfig.  Adds "make baseline" and "make bloatcheck"
using Matt Mackall's bloat-o-meter, and scripts/showasm.</p>

<p>Screwing up the web page a bit, adding an index bar along the side
which doesn't properly connect up to anything yet.  (Busy implementing
mke2fs and gene2fs.)</p>

<p><b>October 30, 2006</b> -
Toybox <a href=downloads/toybox-0.0.1.tar.bz2>0.0.1 release</a>.  Implements
df, a skeletal toysh, and some library functions.  Proof of concept, really.</p>

<p><b>September 7, 2006</b> -
Project launched, first commit to mercurial archive.</p>
