<h2>What is ToyBox?</h2>

<p>Toybox aims to implement all the Linux command line utilities in under one
megabyte.  This project aims for small, simple, and efficient implementations,
with configurable levels of functionality.  It should scale from tiny embedded
systems up to full fledged desktop and development environments.</p>

<p>The project is <a href=license.html>Licensed under GPL version 2</a>.</p>

<p>Toybox can be built as a single "swiss army knife" executable (ala BusyBox
or Red Hat's Nash), or each command can be built as a traditional independent
executable.</p>

<h2>Which commands are planned?</h2>

<b><h3>Relevant Standards</h3></b>

<p>Most commands are implemented according to
<a href=http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/idx/utilities.html>The
Single Unix Specification version 3</a>.  This does not mean that Toybox is
implementing every SUSv3 utility: some such as SCCS and ed are obsolete, while
others such as c99 are outside the scope of the project.  Toybox also isn't
implementing full internationalization support: it should be 8-bit clean and
handle UTF-8, but otherwise we leave this to X11 and higher layers.</p>

<p>The other major sources of commands are the Linux man pages, and testing
the behavior of existing commands (although not generally looking at their
source code).</p>

<b><h3>Command Shell</h3></b>
<p>The Toybox Shell aims to be a reasonable bash replacement.  It implements
the "sh" and "toysh" commands, plus the built-in commands "cd" and "exit".
The following additional commands may be built into the shell (but not as
separate executables): cd, exit, if, while, for, function, fg, bg, jobs, source,
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/alias.html">alias</a>,
export, set, unset, read, trap, and exec.</p>

<b><h3>General Purpose Commands:</h3></b>

<p>[TODO]</p>

<b><h3>Development tools:</h3></b>

<p>Commands: ar, make [TODO]</p>

<b><h2>What commands are implemented?</h2></b>

<p>Toybox is a work in progress, and nowhere near a 1.0 release.  The first
commit was September 27, 2006, and work is ongoing.</p>

<p>Partial (in progress): sh/toysh (cd, exit), df, which.</p>

<p>Complete: hello, pwd.</p>

<b><h2>Download</h2></b>

<p>This project is maintained as a mercurial archive.  To get a copy of the
current development version, "hg clone static-http://landley.net/code/toybox",
or check <a href=download>the download directory</a> for release tarballs.
</p>

<p>My <a href=/notes.html>development log</a> is currently the best way to
track what's going on with this project.  When I get this moved to my new
server, I need to put up a mailing list and repository browser, make this a
real web page, add toybox.landley.net as a virtual domain...</p>
