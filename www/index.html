<p>This project is maintained as a mercurial archive.  To get a copy of the
current development version, "hg clone static-http://landley.net/code/toybox",
or check <a href=download>the download directory</a> for release tarballs.
</p>

<p>My <a href=/notes.html>development log</a> is currently the best way to
track what's going on with this project.  When I get this moved to my new
server, I need to put up a mailing list and repository browser, make this a
real web page, add toybox.landley.net as a virtual domain...</p>
