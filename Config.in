config TOYBOX
	bool
	default n
	help
	  usage: toybox [command] [arguments...]

	  With no arguments, shows available commands.  First argument is
	  name of a command to run, followed by any arguments to that command.

config TOYBOX_SUID
	bool "SUID support"
	default y
	help
	  Support for suid commands, which run as root.  This means toybox must
	  be installed suid root, and drops permissions before running commands
	  which do not require root access.

config TOYBOX_FLOAT
	bool "Floating point support"
	default y
	help
	  Include floating point support infrastructure and commands that
	  require it.

config TOYBOX_FREE
	bool "Free memory unnecessarily"
	default n
	help
	  When a program exits, the operating system will clean up after it
	  (free memory, close files, etc).  To save size, toybox usually relies
	  on this behavior.  If you're running toybox under a debugger or
	  without a real OS (ala newlib+libgloss), enable this to make toybox
	  clean up after itself.

config TOYBOX_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging tests"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra checks for debugging purposes.
