config TOYBOX
	bool
	default y
	help
	  usage: toybox [command] [arguments...]

	  With no arguments, shows available commands. First argument is
	  name of a command to run, followed by any arguments to that command.

config TOYBOX_SUID
	bool "SUID support"
	default y
	help
	  Support for the Set User ID bit, to install toybox suid root and drop
	  permissions for commands which do not require root access. To use
	  this change ownership of the file to the root user and set the suid
	  bit in the file permissions:

	  chown root:root toybox; chmod +s toybox

config TOYBOX_FLOAT
	bool "Floating point support"
	default y
	help
	  Include floating point support infrastructure and commands that
	  require it.

config TOYBOX_HELP
	bool "Help messages"
	default y
	help
	  Include help text for each command.

config TOYBOX_HELP_DASHDASH
	bool "--help"
	default y
	depends on TOYBOX_HELP
	help
	  Support --help argument in all commands, even ones with a NULL
	  optstring. Produces the same output as "help command".

config TOYBOX_I18N
	bool "Internationalization support"
	default y
	help
	  Support for UTF-8 character sets, and some locale support.

config TOYBOX_FREE
	bool "Free memory unnecessarily"
	default n
	help
	  When a program exits, the operating system will clean up after it
	  (free memory, close files, etc). To save size, toybox usually relies
	  on this behavior. If you're running toybox under a debugger or
	  without a real OS (ala newlib+libgloss), enable this to make toybox
	  clean up after itself.

config TOYBOX_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging tests"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra checks for debugging purposes.
