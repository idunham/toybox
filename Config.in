	  When a program exits, the operating system will clean up after it
	  (free memory, close files, etc).  To save size, toybox usually relies
	  on this behavior.  If you're running toybox under a debugger or
	  without a real OS (ala newlib+libgloss), enable this to make toybox
	  clean up after itself.
