Toybox: all-in-one Linux command line.

--- Building Toybox

Type "make help" for build instructions.

Mostly you want:

  CFLAGS="--static" CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l- make defconfig toybox install

Or "make menuconfig", which produces the same sort of .config file as the
Linux kernel.

--- Using toybox

The build produces a "swiss-army-knife" style multifunction binary, which acts
differently depending on the name it was called as (cp, mv, cat...), and
installs symlinks under each command name to populate $PATH.

The "toybox" command itself uses its first argument as the command name to run
(ala "toybox ls -l").  With no arguments, it lists available commands.  (This
allows you to use the commands even without the symlinks.)

The "help" command provides information about each command (ala "help cat").

The toybox web page is at "http://landley.net/toybox".

Have fun,
